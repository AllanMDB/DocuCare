# Overview

DocuCare, trademark pending, is a Doctor-Patient Platform that transforms recorded medical information into concise summaries and actionable insights for both doctors and patients. Doctors can analyze similar symptoms across patients, while patients can ask follow-up questions based on their history, fostering efficient and informed healthcare communication. DocuCare aims to enhance the doctor-patient relationship through intelligent data utilization.

# Justification
 
_Please explain why you decided to build the application/demonstration for this project. What inspired you? What problems does it solve or how will it make Presales activities easier?_

Just like Docucare shows, MongoDBâ€™s developer data platform allows organizations to integrates all of the data services you need to build modern applications in a unified developer experience. It handles transactional workloads, full-text search, AI-enhanced experiences, stream data processing, and more, all while reducing data infrastructure sprawl and complexity!
